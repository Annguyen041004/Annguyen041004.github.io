### CPSC 120

* Lab 10 

      Lab 10 Part 2 was another enjoyable lab for me. It felt like I was 
      creating a report for each city in California. I was able to write
      a function that accurately matched each city with its corresponding 
      population by utilizing the given data.  

* Lab 11  

      I really like Lab 11 Part 2 because this is the lab where I 
      experience using random numbers to create a secret number 
      guessing game. I was able to code instead of adding 
      pre-specified numbers inside the code, now I can use the 
      random number generator to play the game. And the code also 
      makes me feel interested when I use what is already in the 
      professor's code instead of creating my own, which increases 
      the lab's difficulty. 

* Lab 12 

      I enjoyed Lab 12 Part 1 because it was in this lab that I first learned 
      how to make an animated gif. A function with color specifiers that move 
      simultaneously in a horizontal and vertical frame can be made by me. 
      By using only the colors red, green, and blue, it gave me an 
      unforgettable experience in understanding how to calculate the color scheme 
      so that it has an impact in every area, regardless of whether the color 
      changes. In this incredible lab experience, I found the answers to those 
      questions.
